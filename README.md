For the sample script in `hasa.py`, X-37B dimensions are used. When certain dimensions aren't available online, estimated quantities derived from a fairly accurate CAD model are used.

The total weight is available online; the propellant weight is deduced from a final report for a graduate course at Colorado University (https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/kantha/sites/default/files/attached-files/final_project_johnson.pdf).
